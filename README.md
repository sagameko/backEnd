# BackEnd
In order to run Laravel, you guys need to install Xampp as well as Composer

After download Xammp, you guys can then run this back end project on local host, i set the default port for that is 8000
The comment in terminal to run the back end is: php artisan serve
* please aware that the back end files can not connect to the database, since my database is located in my xampp phpAdmin, in order to have the same database with me currently,
you guys can just use the Admin Mysql in Xampp to gain access to the phpAdmin
after that, please create a new database named "backend", then go to the sql code and parse the sql code below to create the database that i currently have:
